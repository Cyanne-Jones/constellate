# Constellate

### What is Constellate?

Constellate is a web application to keep track of your thoughts and moods over time, like an online journal only accessible to you. If youâ€™re tired of having too many physical journals to count, and are hoping for something a little more consistent and structured, constellate is built with you in mind.

### Create an entry

Every day youâ€™re able to create a new journal entry with your thoughts, a title, a mood and a color that today feels like. When you click the save button, you can view the entry on your calendar.

###  Navigate your calendar

From the calendar, youâ€™re able to reflect on your past entries at a birdâ€™s eye view. You can click into your entry to view and edit it.

### Mobile responsive

Constellate is meant to keep your thoughts wherever youâ€™re at, which means on the go as well as when youâ€™re at your computer, so feel free to bring Constellate with you wherever you are.
